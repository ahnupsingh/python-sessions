## Project Directory:

- This is the main directory containing your entire Django project.
- It typically has the same name as your Django project.
- It serves as the root directory for your project.

## Apps

- Django projects are typically organized into multiple apps, each representing a distinct functionality or feature.
- Each app is a Python package containing models, views, URLs, templates, and other components related to a specific feature.
- Apps are usually stored in a directory named after the app, within the project directory.
- /ramailo is an directory that represents an app in our project.


### builders:

This directory contains builder classes or functions responsible for creating complex objects or data structures.
Builders are commonly used to encapsulate object creation logic and provide a fluent interface for constructing objects.

### helpers:

The helpers directory contains utility functions or helper classes used across your application.
Helper functions can provide common functionality or perform tasks such as data formatting, validation, or manipulation.

### middlewares:

Middleware classes in Django provide a way to hook into the request/response processing pipeline.
The middlewares directory contains custom middleware classes that intercept and modify requests or responses as they pass through the middleware stack.

### migrations:

Django migrations are used to manage changes to your database schema over time.
The migrations directory contains migration files generated by Django's makemigrations command, which define database schema changes.

### models:

The models directory contains Django model classes that represent database tables and define the structure of your application's data.
Each model class typically corresponds to a database table and defines fields, relationships, and behavior.

### serializers:

Serializers in Django REST Framework (DRF) are used to convert complex data types, such as querysets and model instances, into native Python data types that can be easily rendered into JSON or XML.
The serializers directory contains serializer classes used to serialize and deserialize data for API endpoints.

### services:

The services directory contains service classes or modules responsible for implementing business logic or coordinating interactions between different parts of your application.
Service classes encapsulate specific functionalities and promote modularity and separation of concerns.

### templates:

The templates directory typically contains HTML template files used to render views.
Django looks for template files in this directory when rendering views using the Django template engine.

### tests:

The tests directory contains test cases for your Django app.
Test files can include unit tests, integration tests, and functional tests to ensure the correctness and reliability of your application.

### views:

The views directory contains Django view functions or classes responsible for handling HTTP requests and returning HTTP responses.
Views encapsulate request processing logic and interact with models, serializers, services, and other components to generate responses.
