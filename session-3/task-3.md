# Task 3 : Stock Price Monitoring

## Overview
In this task, you will simulate a stock price monitoring and triggering system. 
The goal is to create a service that 
- fetches stock prices,
- compares them against user-defined triggers,
- saves the data
- notifies the user when a condition is met

## Objectives
- Implement custom service-oriented architecture.
- Build and organize business logic using services.
- Interact with external APIs and process the data.
- Design and expose REST APIs to interact with a system.
- Implement caching with Redis.
- Work with databases to store and retrieve data.


## Notes
The solution will involve multiple components like a service, API, and database integration.
